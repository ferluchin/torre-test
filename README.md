# Torre SW Engineering - Technical Test

I developed an application that meets the expectations and requirements of the technical test proposed by Torre.

## Description

The application provides the ability to:

1. **List Skills:** Upon entering a username, the application lists the skills of the user.
2. **Skill Details:** By clicking on a particular skill, the application displays:
   - Details associated with that skill and the user.
   - A list of related experiences from that user.
   - A list of people who possess the same skill.
   - And other details I deemed relevant.

In addition to these functionalities, I ensured the application was:

- Scalable and maintainable.
- High quality and responsive.
- User-friendly with a good interface and user experience.

## Instructions to Run the Application

As this application was built using React.js, you can follow these steps to run it:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [REPOSITORY_URL]
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd [DIRECTORY_NAME]
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the application in development mode:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Upon running `npm start`, the application should open in your default web browser. If not, you can manually access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Live Version

You can access the live version of the application deployed on Netlify [here](https://torre-test3.netlify.app/).

## Deliverables

- Repository URL for code review.
- Deployed application link (if applicable).
- Reflections on the work done, areas for improvement, and what could've been accomplished with more time.
